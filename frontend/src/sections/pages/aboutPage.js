          <h1>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME...</h1>
          <h2>
            I'm a part-time award winning and published photographer and
            full-time student pursuing a career in software development. My
            journey started in 2021 when I took a gap year to travel around the
            world with my camera in hand. Since then I've been working on
            various projects, including wedding photography, street photography,
            and landscape photography. My passion currenttly lies with analog
            photography, but I'm also proficient in digital photography as well.
            Additionally, I have a strong interest in filmmaking, having made
            several short films as well as a feature length film. These films
            are experimental in nature, often exploring themes of identity and
            memory with a focus on the structural elements of film. I'm
            currently based in Bergen, Norway, where I'm set to graduate with a
            bachelor in informatics from the University of Bergen in December
            2024. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so
            feel free to reach out to me!
