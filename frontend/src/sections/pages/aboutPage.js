        <h2>
          I'm a part-time award winning and published photographer and full-time student pursuing a career in software development.
          My journey started in 2021 when I took a gap year to travel around the world with my camera in hand.
          Since then I've been working on various projects, including wedding photography, street photography, and landscape photography.
          My passion currenttly lies with analog photography, but I'm also proficient in digital photography as well.

          Additionally, I have a strong interest in filmmaking, having made several short films as well as a feature length film.
          These films are experimental in nature, often exploring themes of identity and memory with a focus on the structural elements of film.

          I'm currently based in Bergen, Norway, where I'm set to graduate with a bachelor in informatics from the University of Bergen in December 2024.
          I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out to me!
